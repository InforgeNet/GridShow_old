## Usage

In the admin panel you will find the _GridShow_ menu. Here, you can add new
tiles to display to your users. You can set as many tiles as you want but the
add-on will display only the first 12 tiles.

Users must have the `View tiles` permission set to view the tiles in homepage
(default enabled). Admins must have the `Manage GridShow tiles` permission set
to view the _GridShow_ menu in the admin panel.

From `Appearence > Style properties > GridShow Widget` you can modify the style
of the addon.
